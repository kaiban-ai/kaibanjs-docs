### The Challenge
Announcing product updates often requires creating promotional content tailored for multiple platforms, such as:
- **Tweets** for X (Twitter) that are concise yet impactful.
- **LinkedIn posts** that are professional and engaging.
- **Blog articles** that provide in-depth insights.
- **Discord announcements** that excite and inform the community.

Manually drafting, refining, and aligning these pieces can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies, especially when updates need to be released quickly.

### The Solution with KaibanJS
KaibanJS solves this problem with an automated workflow using intelligent agents. This process enables teams to create polished content for different platforms based on a single input containing the product name, release notes URL, GitHub repository link, and community link.

### Traditional Approach Challenges

Creating release announcements traditionally involves:
1. **Manual Drafting:** Writing individual posts for each platform requires significant effort.
2. **Content Review:** Ensuring tone consistency and quality involves multiple rounds of edits.
3. **Formatting Adjustments:** Customizing format and style for each platform increases complexity.
4. **Coordination:** Gathering inputs from multiple stakeholders often causes delays.
5. **Scalability Issues:** Repeating this process for frequent updates can overwhelm teams.

KaibanJS eliminates these bottlenecks through intelligent task automation and agent collaboration.

### The Agentic Solution
KaibanJS leverages a team of specialized agents, each focusing on a critical aspect of content creation to ensure seamless automation:

:::agents
- **ContentExtractor:** Responsible for analyzing the provided release notes, this agent identifies key updates, new features, and enhancements. It structures the extracted information to be clear and easily reusable for different platforms.

- **TweetComposer and Evaluator:** These agents generate and refine concise, engaging tweets. The composer drafts multiple tweet options, while the evaluator ensures clarity, proper tone, and adherence to formatting guidelines like hashtags and emojis.

- **LinkedInPostComposer and Evaluator:** The LinkedIn agents create and polish professional posts that highlight key features and use cases. They focus on maintaining an engaging and informative tone suitable for a professional audience.

- **DiscordCopyComposer and Evaluator:** These agents develop community-friendly announcements tailored for Discord. They ensure enthusiasm, clarity, and proper Markdown formatting to enhance readability.

- **BlogPostComposer and Evaluator:** Focused on long-form content, these agents draft detailed, SEO-optimized blog posts. The evaluator reviews and refines the content to align with platform guidelines and ensure readability and impact.

- **ResultAggregator:** Once all the content is created and refined, this agent compiles the outputs into a single Markdown document, organizing tweets, LinkedIn posts, blog articles, and Discord announcements for easy publication.
