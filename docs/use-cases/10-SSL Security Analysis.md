### Traditional Approach Challenges
SSL security audits are typically conducted manually by security teams or system administrators. These traditional methods come with notable challenges:

1. **Certificate Enumeration:** Security professionals must manually query SSL certificate databases like crt.sh to retrieve certificate details for a given domain.
2. **Risk Analysis:** Identifying potential vulnerabilities in SSL configurations requires expertise and manual review of certificate issuers, expiration dates, and security policies.
3. **Report Generation:** Creating structured reports with risk assessments, compliance checks, and security recommendations is a time-intensive task.

*Note: This use case automates SSL certificate retrieval, analysis, and report generation while leaving final security decisions to human experts.*

### The Agentic Solution
KaibanJS automates SSL security analysis by leveraging intelligent agents that fetch and analyze SSL certificates, generate security reports, and recommend improvements.

- **Scenario:** Auditing SSL certificates for a given domain to ensure compliance, security, and proper configuration.

Before diving into the automated process, let‚Äôs introduce the **key Agent** responsible for this task:

:::agents
- **SSL Certificate Analyzer:**
  - **Retrieves** certificates using crt.sh.
  - **Analyzes** certificate details, including issuers, validity periods, and risks.
  - **Identifies** subdomains associated with the target domain.
  - **Generates** a structured security report with recommendations.
:::

### Process Overview
Here‚Äôs how the agent-driven workflow automates SSL certificate analysis:

:::tasks
1. **Certificate Retrieval:** The agent queries crt.sh via a proxy to fetch SSL certificate data for the target domain.
2. **Security Analysis:** Extracts subdomain information, certificate issuers, expiration dates, and potential misconfigurations.
3. **Risk Assessment:** Flags vulnerabilities such as outdated certificates, wildcard usage risks, and compatibility issues.
4. **Report Generation:** Creates a structured SSL security report in markdown format, highlighting risks and recommended actions.
:::

### Outcome
The result is an automatically generated **SSL Security Report** that provides:

- A list of subdomains associated with the target domain.
- Certificate issuer details, validity periods, and expiration warnings.
- Identification of potential security risks and misconfigurations.
- Actionable recommendations for improving SSL security posture.

By leveraging KaibanJS for SSL security analysis, cybersecurity teams and IT administrators can **streamline their workflow**, **reduce manual effort**, and **improve security monitoring** with AI-powered automation.

### Expected Benefits
- **Automated Security Audits:** Reduce manual effort by automating SSL certificate retrieval and analysis.
- **Faster Threat Detection:** Quickly identify security risks related to SSL misconfigurations.
- **Structured Compliance Reporting:** Generate consistent and detailed security reports for audit and compliance purposes.
- **Enhanced Domain Protection:** Improve overall web security by proactively identifying vulnerabilities.
