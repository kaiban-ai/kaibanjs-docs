In today's cybersecurity landscape, ensuring SSL certificate integrity and domain security is crucial for businesses, website owners, and IT security teams. Manually analyzing SSL certificates and identifying vulnerabilities can be time-consuming and prone to oversight.

### Traditional Approach Challenges
SSL security audits are typically conducted manually by security teams or system administrators. These traditional methods come with notable challenges:

1. **Certificate Enumeration:** Security professionals must manually query SSL certificate databases like crt.sh to retrieve certificate details for a given domain.
2. **Risk Analysis:** Identifying potential vulnerabilities in SSL configurations requires expertise and manual review of certificate issuers, expiration dates, and security policies.
3. **Report Generation:** Creating structured reports with risk assessments, compliance checks, and security recommendations is a time-intensive task.

*Note: This use case automates SSL certificate retrieval, analysis, and report generation while leaving final security decisions to human experts.*

### The Agentic Solution
KaibanJS automates SSL security analysis by leveraging intelligent agents that fetch and analyze SSL certificates, generate security reports, and recommend improvements.

- **Scenario:** Auditing SSL certificates for a given domain to ensure compliance, security, and proper configuration.

Before diving into the automated process, let‚Äôs introduce the **key Agent** responsible for this task:

:::agents
- **SSL Certificate Analyzer:**
  - **Retrieves** certificates using crt.sh.
  - **Analyzes** certificate details, including issuers, validity periods, and risks.
  - **Identifies** subdomains associated with the target domain.
  - **Generates** a structured security report with recommendations.
:::

### Process Overview
Here‚Äôs how the agent-driven workflow automates SSL certificate analysis:

:::tasks
1. **Certificate Retrieval:** The agent queries crt.sh via a proxy to fetch SSL certificate data for the target domain.
2. **Security Analysis:** Extracts subdomain information, certificate issuers, expiration dates, and potential misconfigurations.
3. **Risk Assessment:** Flags vulnerabilities such as outdated certificates, wildcard usage risks, and compatibility issues.
4. **Report Generation:** Creates a structured SSL security report in markdown format, highlighting risks and recommended actions.

### Implementation
Below is an example of how this automation is implemented using KaibanJS:

```javascript
import { Agent, Task, Team } from 'kaibanjs';
import { Tool } from "@langchain/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";
import axios from "axios";

// === CRTTool ===
export class CRTTool extends Tool {
  constructor(fields) {
    super(fields);
    this.name = "crt_tool";
    this.description = "Fetches JSON data of certificates from crt.sh for a given domain using a CORS proxy.";
    this.schema = z.object({
      domain: z
        .string()
        .describe("The domain to fetch certificate JSON data for."),
    });
  }

  async _call(input) {
    try {
      const requestUrl = `https://api.allorigins.win/raw?url=${encodeURIComponent(
        `https://crt.sh/json?q=${input.domain}`
      )}`;
      const response = await axios.get(requestUrl);

      // Parse the raw JSON response
      const data = response.data;
      if (typeof data === 'string') {
        return JSON.parse(data); // Ensure string JSON is parsed
      }
      return data;
    } catch (error) {
      return `Error fetching JSON data from crt.sh: ${error.message}`;
    }
  }
}

// Tool instance
const crtTool = new CRTTool();

// === AGENTS ===
const sslAnalyzer = new Agent({
  name: 'SSL Certificate Analyzer',
  role: 'SSL Certificate Security Analyst',
  goal: 'Analyze SSL certificates and generate detailed security reports',
  background: 'Expert in SSL certificate analysis and domain security configuration',
  description: `Analyzes SSL certificate data issued for the domain {domain} and generates a report in {language}. Provides a report including:

- List of identified subdomains
- Information about certificate issuers and validity periods
- Potential risks related to subdomains and SSL configuration
- Recommendations to improve domain security`,
  tools: [crtTool],
});

// === TASKS ===
const analyzeSSL = new Task({
  name: 'analyze_ssl',
  description: 'Analyzes SSL certificates for {domain} and generates a security report in {language}',
  agent: sslAnalyzer,

# üîí SSL Security Report for {domain}

*Generated by [Nimbox360](https://nimbox360.com) with KaibanJS*

## üìä Executive Summary
[Brief description of analysis and key findings]

## üåê Identified Subdomains
- List of found subdomains
- Each on a separate line with bullet point

## üìú SSL Certificates
| Domain | Issuer | Valid From | Valid Until | Status |
|---------|---------|--------------|--------------|---------|
[Table with certificate information]

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Certificate Compatibility
If Let's Encrypt certificates are detected:
- ‚ùó Let's Encrypt certificates are not compatible with older iPhone devices
- ‚ùó May present issues with older operating system versions
- üí° Consider commercial certificates for broader compatibility

## üö® Risk Analysis
1. [Identified Risk]
   - Risk details
   - Potential impact
2. [Next risk...]

### üîç Information Exposure
- Evaluation of critical subdomain exposure
- Identification of potential entry points for attackers

## üí° Recommendations
1. **Wildcard Certificates**
   - üõ°Ô∏è Use wildcard certificates (*.domain.com) to hide specific subdomains
   - üîê Reduces exposure of sensitive information
   - üìä Simplifies certificate management

2. **Security Improvements**
   - üîÑ Implement automatic certificate renewal
   - üõ°Ô∏è Configure HSTS to prevent attacks
