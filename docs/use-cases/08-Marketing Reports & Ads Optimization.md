// === UrlMarkdown Tool ===
export class UrlMarkdown extends Tool {
  constructor(fields) {
    super(fields);
    this.name = "url_markdown_tool";
    this.description = "Gets content in Markdown format from a URL.";
    this.schema = z.object({
      url: z
        .string()
        .url()
        .describe("The URL from which to extract content in Markdown format."),
    });
  }

  async _call(input) {
    try {
      const requestUrl = `https://r.jina.ai/${encodeURIComponent(input.url)}`;
      const response = await axios.get(requestUrl);
      return response.data;
    } catch (error) {
      return `Error getting content from URL: ${error.message}`;
    }
  }
}
